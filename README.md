DSA Training using JavaScript for better problem solving and understanding
Start with small problems which involves least amount of time and work to complete eg: largest number in an array....
Work on multiple solutions for the same problem.
Try to find the time complexity of each solution and achieve the most optimal approach to a problem.
Write down comments in code for better understanding.
Create different files for complex problems that require more insight and outside help.
Make use of AI tools to analyse the problems and achieve the optimal solution only after trying to figure the the worst case solution and failure.
